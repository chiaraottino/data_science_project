# Student Performance Analysis Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Student Performance Analysis Project repository! This project is dedicated to modeling complex datasets to provide in-depth analytical reports. Our aim is to uncover insights from the "Student Attitude and Behavior" dataset downloadable from Kabble https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/susanta21/student-attitude-and-behavior to better understand the factors influencing student performance and well-being.

### Objectives
- **Demographic Analysis**: Explore student diversity in education.
- **Academic Performance**: Understand the correlation between study habits and academic results.
- **Lifestyle and Well-being**: Examine the impact of lifestyle choices on student stress levels.
- **Career Aspirations**: Investigate students' career expectations in relation to their degree satisfaction.
- **Part-time Work**: Assess the effects of part-time jobs on students' academic and personal lives.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into several directories, each serving a distinct role in the project workflow:

```plaintext

│ ├── student-mat.csv
│ ├── student-por.csv
│ └── metadata.txt
├── src/
│ ├── data_preprocessing.py
│ ├── exploratory_analysis.py
│ └── predictive_modeling.py
├── tests/

```


### `data/`
This directory contains all raw and derived datasets. For detailed information on the datasets, refer to `metadata.txt`.

### `src/`
Here you'll find all the source code used for data analysis and model training. The scripts are named according to the part of the project they correspond to.

### `tests/`
Contains automated tests for the source code to ensure reliability and accuracy of the algorithms used.

### `analyses/`
Jupyter notebooks or R Markdown files detailing exploratory data analyses, statistical tests, and model development are stored here.

### `outputs/`
This folder is reserved for the output from scripts and analyses, including intermediate data files, figures, and serialized models.

### `reports/`
You can find the detailed project reports here, which include methodology, results, and discussions on the findings.

### `makefile`
An automation tool to run scripts that compile the entire project or specific parts, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly accounted for.
